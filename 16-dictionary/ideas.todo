I'll add these suggestions later on, but to improve your Frontend skills you could:
 - [ ] Add an option to add Spanish or multi-language support.
 - [ ] Implement a dark mode feature.
 - [ ] Add animations to the user interface taking into account mobile effects too (because of the touch interactions).
